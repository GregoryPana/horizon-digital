You are an expert product designer + senior front-end engineer. Build a complete marketing website for my business using React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS.

BUSINESS:

- Name: Horizon Digital
- Tagline (primary): “Empowering Your Digital Horizon”
- Optional long form: “Empowering Your Digital Horizon — one website at a time”
- The business is a boutique web design studio (solo founder) with room to scale into a broader digital brand later.
- Target clients: guesthouses/boutique hotels (not luxury-focused), restaurants/cafés, local SMEs and service businesses; also internationally.
- Positioning: modern, growth-focused, high-performance websites and reliable support (NOT luxury-only, NOT “AI solutions leader” positioning).

SERVICES TO SHOW:

- Custom website design + build
- Redesign / modernization
- Mobile-first responsive build
- Performance/speed optimization
- SEO-ready foundation (technical basics)
- Conversion-focused layout + CTA strategy
  Optional add-ons: contact/booking forms, menus, galleries, basic analytics, maintenance retainers.

SITE MAP (nav):
Home, Services, Work, Process, Pricing, About, Contact.
No blog for now.

HOME SECTIONS (in order):
Hero, Trust bar, Services grid, Featured work/portfolio, Process (4 steps), Pricing preview (3 tiers), FAQ, Final CTA, Footer.

WORK/PORTFOLIO:
Use 6 project cards as placeholders labeled “Concept Demo” (do not fake real clients). Each card has: industry label (e.g., Guesthouse, Restaurant), short outcome statement (e.g., “Modern booking-focused layout”), and buttons: “View preview” (opens modal) + “Request similar site” (links to contact).
Include image placeholders with gradients.

PROCESS (4 steps):

1. Discovery & goals
2. Design & prototype
3. Build & launch
4. Support & improvement

PRICING:
3 tiers with “From” pricing placeholders + feature bullets + CTA.
Include note: “Final pricing depends on scope.”

ABOUT:
Short founder-style copy (without using personal name). Emphasize boutique quality, direct communication, reliability, and long-term growth mindset.

CONTACT:
Simple form (name/email/message) + contact email display.
Add a “Book a free consult” CTA button.

FOOTER:
Include a reusable credit line snippet:
“Website designed by Horizon Digital. Need a tailored web solution? hello@horizondigital.com”
(Use a variable for the email so I can change it easily.)

DESIGN LANGUAGE:

- Dark-first premium UI with teal glow accents.
- Subtle glassmorphism for cards/panels (backdrop blur, translucent surfaces).
- Minimalist layout, bold sans-serif typography (no serif).
- Use a “horizon line” motif as dividers/underlines in a few places.
- Microinteractions: hover lift, button glow, smooth transitions.
- Accessible contrast and focus states. Support reduced-motion.

THEMING:
Implement dark/light mode toggle.
Use CSS variables for design tokens and Tailwind utility classes.
Dark palette: deep teal/near-black background, glass surfaces, teal glow accents.
Light palette: off-white background, teal accent continuity.

LOGO:
Use my provided logo image as the navbar brand mark and footer mark. If image not available, use an inline SVG fallback: geometric “H” made from two vertical angular pillars separated by a glowing horizontal teal line (the horizon).
Text lockup: HORIZON (bold white) with DIGITAL beneath in teal.
Make the logo area clean, premium, and centered in layouts.

TECH REQUIREMENTS:

- React + TypeScript components
- TailwindCSS styling
- Responsive for mobile/desktop
- No external UI libraries required (but acceptable if minimal)
- Clean component structure: Layout, Navbar, Footer, Button, Card, Section components
- Provide full code in one response (or clearly separated files if you must)
- Include a simple routing setup (React Router) for the pages.

OUTPUT:
Return the complete codebase (or a single-file version if needed) and concise instructions to run it.

Use generous spacing and strong hierarchy. Avoid clutter.

Make it feel like a premium studio site, not a template.
