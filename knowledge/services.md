## What we do
Horizon Digital builds custom, clear, fast websites for Seychelles businesses. Each site is designed to be easy to navigate, easy to find, and focused on helping visitors take action.

## Who this is for
We work with local businesses that want a professional online presence and a simple path for customers to contact or book. Typical industries include hospitality, retail, services, and professional firms.

## Core services

## What “custom” means
Your website is built around your goals, content, and audience. Starter and Growth packages are not templates. Foundation uses a structured Horizon Digital layout with limited customisation.

## What we can add
We can add WhatsApp integration, contact forms, booking or enquiry forms, Google Maps, and other scoped add-ons.

## What a website includes (for any business)
- Design and build: how your website looks, reads, and guides visitors.
- Domain name: your web address (like yourbusiness.com), renewed yearly through a registrar.
- Hosting: the service that keeps your website online and accessible.

Horizon Digital can design and build your website, guide domain setup and renewals, and manage hosting if you want one team handling everything.
